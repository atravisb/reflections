What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

To initialise the repo you use the command: git init (in the relevant dir)
Initialising a new repo creates a new .git dir for tracking file metadata
Initially there are no commits and no tracked files in the repo

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is just an ordinary directory, containing files.
The repository bundles files together and records metadata about their
history in a newly created .git folder (within the working directory).
The staging area allows you to control the manner in which files from the 
working directory are added to the repository. This control allows one or 
more files that are logically separate from the other files in the working 
directory to be added to the repository as part of separate commits.  Also,
you can choose to add only a subset of the files in the working directory
to the repo.
