When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

Using a remote repository would be handy when collaborating on a project with 
other people or if you wanted to work on a project from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

push = sending local repo changes to GitHub
pull = receiving GitHub changes in local repo
Pulling manually allows for greater control in what you bring down into your
local repo.  You only really need to update your local repo when you plan to
work on it and might avoid unnecessary transfers that might occur if pulls
were automated.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

Branching is undertaken on a single repository, with two or more branches
sharing the same ancestor code.  You might undertake branching if you want to
experiment with a new feature or try out some significant changes to your code,
without the risk of breaking the existing code.
Cloning involves making a copy of an entire repository.  You might do this to
copy a GitHub repository down to your local computer or to make a new copy of
an existing local repository in a different location on your computer.
Forking is a form of cloning; it occurs on GitHub when one GitHub repository 
is copied to create a new GitHub repository.  You fork to get a copy of the 
code for an existing project on GitHub, without directly affecting that project 
(although you may ultimately contribute your changes back to the original 
codebase by way of a pull request.)
