When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

Using a remote repository would be handy when collaborating on a project with 
other people or if you wanted to work on a project from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

push = sending local repo changes to GitHub
pull = receiving GitHub changes in local repo
Pulling manually allows for greater control in what you bring down into your
local repo.  You only really need to update your local repo when you plan to
work on it and might avoid unnecessary transfers that might occur if pulls
were automated.
